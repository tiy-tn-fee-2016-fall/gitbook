## Setting up Adonis Projects

* Run `adonis new` to create a new project
* Remember to `git init` and commit since `adonis new` does not start up a git project
* Remove `--harmony__proxies` or change to `--harmony` in `ace` and in `package.json` to support Node >6.7
* Run `npm run dev` to start development server
* Install database using `npm install sqlite3 --save` (or `npm install pg --save` when using PostgreSQL)
